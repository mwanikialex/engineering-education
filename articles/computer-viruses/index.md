 A computer virus operates by attaching itself to a program or a document to execute its code.
### Early computer history of computer viruses

### How computer viruses spread 
computer viruses can be contracted in many ways with ease due to increased connectivity in the world and the introduction of the internet. Before the introduction of the internet, viruses would spread from computer to computer through infected floppy disks.
You can turn on your computer and suddenly have a virus for no reason, but it has to be installed into your computer system first. Here are the common three ways computer viruses spread.

 computer viruses can’t infect your computer through a text-only email unless it contains an attachment or a clickable link. If you open the email and click on the foreign link or open the received attachment, your computer downloads that information and if the link/attachment contains a virus, your computer will be infected.

##### 2. Internet downloads
 Viruses can also be spread through internet file downloads. Computers can also be infected through applications downloads. Most of the virus attaches to freebie downloads, which includes free software trials, or even more ironically, free antivirus software programs.

##### 3. Removable media
You can also import viruses into your computer system when you attach infected removable media like a memory card, USB flash drive, and external hard drive. If a hacker attached a virus program or a file on the removable drive, the virus will be installed when you plug in the drive.
### How computer viruses attack
The virus will at first be temporarily inactive until the computer executes its code. For the virus to infect a computer, the infected program, file or document must be run which in turn will cause the code to be executed. This generally means that the virus remains in your computer without showing any signs.
